- `nexus tool set-invocation-cost` to set the invocation cost for a tool
- `indicatif` crate to handle progress spinners
- `--batch` flag to `nexus tool register` command to allow registering multiple tools at once
- upon tool registration, the CLI will save the owner caps to the CLI conf; these are then used to fall back to if no `--owner-cap` arg is provided for some commands
- `secrets` module that provides a wrapper to encrypt and decrypt its inner values
- `crypto` section to the CLI configuration to save the current state of the `crypto`
- `nexus conf set --sui.rpc-url` to set a custom Sui RPC URL for the CLI to use
- `nexus crypto auth` establishes a secure session with the network
- `nexus crypto generate-identity-key` generates and stores a fresh identity key
- `nexus crypto init-key` generates and stores a random 32-byte master key
- `nexus crypto set-passphrase` prompts for and stores a passphrase securely in the keyring
- `nexus crypto key-status` shows where the key was loaded from
- automatically fetching devnet objects for user ergonomics
- configured `cargo-deny` rules
- not failing if a tool is already registered when registering a tool
- not failing a whole tool registration batch if one of the tools fails to register
- `nexus gas limited-invocations enable` to enable the limited invocations gas extension for a tool
- `nexus gas limited-invocations disable` to disable the limited invocations gas extension for a tool
- `nexus gas limited-invocations buy-ticket` to buy a limited invocations gas ticket for a tool
- `--no-save` flag to `nexus tool register` to not save the owner caps to the CLI config

#### Changed

- JSON DAG definition no longer specifies entry input ports
- renamed JSON DAG `vertices.input_ports` to `vertices.entry_ports`
- `nexus tool list` supports the new `description` and `registered_at_ms` attributes
- tool registration now takes `invocation_cost` parameter and returns 2 owner caps `OverTool` and `OverGas`
- `nexus conf --nexus.objects` is now the only way to populate the `nexus.objects` field in the config
- `nexus conf` changed to have `set` and `get` subcommands
- `nexus dag execute` now takes `--encrypt` argument that accepts `vertex.port` pairs to encrypt before sending data on-chain
- JSON DAG now accepts `encrypted` field on `edges.[].from`
- `nexus dag execute` now encrypts any `vertex.port` mentioned in the arguments
- removed `--encrypt` flag in favour of storing the information in the JSON DAG definition
- replaced all occurrences of `sap` with `tap`

#### Removed

- automated faucet calls for gas and collateral coins
- basic auth from the CLI configuration
- DAG validation (moved to `nexus-sdk`)

#### Fixed

- `create_wallet_context` takes `SUI_RPC_URL` into consideration when checking active env
- when `nexus conf get` fails to parse the config it shows the error instead of defaulting
- `master-key` uses keyring platform specific dependencies
- `nexus crypto auth` fetches a new gas coin now

- support for generating shell completions
- `crypto` module
- `x3dh` in `crypto` that implements X3DH key-exchange protocol according to the Signal Specs.
- `double_ratchet` in `crypto` that implements Double Ratchet with header encryption.
- `session` in `crypto` that glues together X3DH + Double Ratchet for a complete e2d Secure Session Layer.
- generic `secret` type interface for encrypting and decrypting wrapped values
- `transactions::crypto` module containing PTB templates for crypto-related transactions
- `idents::workflow::PreKeyVault` struct that contains pre key vault identifiers
- `pre_key_vault` key to `NexusObjects`
- pre key vault related Nexus events and their definitions
- DAG validation (moved from `nexus-cli`)
- `LinkedTable` support for object crawler
- added identifiers to `tool_registry`'s allow list functions

#### Changed

- `transactions::tool` register PTB template now accepts invocation cost

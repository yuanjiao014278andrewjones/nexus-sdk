//! This module attempts to make a little bit of sense when dealing with Sui
//! types.
//!
//! Some are prefixed with `Sui`, some are not. This re-export will nest all
//! Sui types under `predule::sui` and remove all `Sui` prefixes.
//!
//! This way we can use, for example `sui::ObjectID` in our code.
//!
//! All move types are now also prefixed with `Move` to avoid confusion.
